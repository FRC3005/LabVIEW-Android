# Usage
This library can run on the roboRIO or the LabVIEW development laptop. The example included with the library illustrates this point.

# Provisioning the roboRIO

# Using in the robot project

# Using on the development PC

To run on a Windows machine, you must install Android adb. The easiest way to do this is to install the [Android SDK Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads). The example program will ask for the path to the adb executable which is typically found at

*C:\Users\<your account name>\AppData\Local\Android\sdk1*
